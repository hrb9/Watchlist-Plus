# Watchlist Plus

## Overall Purpose

Watchlist Plus is designed to enhance the Plex viewing experience by providing AI-driven recommendations and streamlined watchlist management. It aims to help users discover new content tailored to their tastes and easily manage their viewing intentions.

## Main Components

The application consists of several interconnected services:

*   **`plexauthgui`**: This service is the primary user interface. It handles authentication with the user's Plex account, provides the main GUI for searching media and viewing recommendations, and allows users to input necessary API keys for other services.
*   **`recbyhistory`**: This service is responsible for generating personalized media recommendations. It analyzes the user's Plex watch history and taste profiles to offer various types of recommendations, including discovery suggestions, monthly picks, and AI-powered search results. It also manages background tasks for fetching and analyzing watch history.
*   **`getimdbid`**: This utility service acts as a bridge for media identifiers. It converts between different IDs (such as IMDb ID and TMDB ID) and fetches essential media details. This is particularly crucial for integrating with other services like Overseerr.
*   **`watchlistrequests`**: This service manages users' watchlist requests. It integrates with Overseerr to request new media and adds selected items to users' Plex watchlists. It also includes logic for auto-approving requests based on predefined criteria.

## Basic Interaction Flow

A typical user interaction with Watchlist Plus follows this flow:

1.  **Authentication**: The user starts by authenticating with their Plex account through the `plexauthgui`.
2.  **Discovery**: Users can then search for media or browse personalized recommendations generated by `recbyhistory` within the `plexauthgui`.
3.  **Watchlist Management**: If a user finds something they want to watch, they can add it to their watchlist via the `plexauthgui`.
4.  **Request Processing**: This action triggers the `watchlistrequests` service.
    *   If the media is not yet available on Plex, `watchlistrequests` can integrate with Overseerr to request it. The `getimdbid` service may be used here to ensure correct media identification.
    *   Once available (or if already available), the item is added to the user's Plex watchlist.
    *   The service also handles any auto-approval logic configured for Overseerr requests.
